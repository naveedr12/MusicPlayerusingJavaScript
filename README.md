## 🎵 Adding Your Own Music

To use your own audio files:

1. **Add audio files** to the `public` folder
2. **Update the track list** in `src/App.tsx`:
   ```typescript
   const sampleTracks: Track[] = [
     {
       id: 1,
       title: "Your Song Title",
       artist: "Artist Name",
       duration: 240, // Duration in seconds
       src: "/path-to-your-audio-file.mp3",
       cover: "/path-to-cover-image.jpg"
     },
     // Add more tracks...
   ];
   ```

## 🎨 Customization

### Color Scheme
The funky theme uses CSS gradients defined in Tailwind classes. To customize colors, modify the gradient classes in `App.tsx`:

```typescript
// Background gradient
className="bg-gradient-to-br from-pink-600 via-purple-600 to-cyan-500"

// Button gradients  
className="bg-gradient-to-r from-yellow-400 via-pink-500 to-cyan-400"
```

### Animations
Animations are handled through Tailwind CSS classes and custom CSS:
- `animate-pulse` - Pulsing effects
- `animate-spin` - Rotating elements
- `transition-all duration-200` - Smooth transitions

## 📱 Responsive Design

The music player is fully responsive and works great on:
- 📱 Mobile devices (320px+)
- 📱 Tablets (768px+)
- 💻 Desktop computers (1024px+)
- 🖥️ Large screens (1440px+)

## 🔧 Available Scripts

- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint for code quality

## 🌟 Key Components

### Audio Management
- Uses HTML5 `<audio>` element for playback
